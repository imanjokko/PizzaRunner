# Creating Temp Tables

--Create a new temporary table extrasBreak to separate extras into multiple rows
~~~sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS extrasBreak;

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE extrasBreak AS
SELECT 
  c.record_id,
  CAST(TRIM(e.extras) AS INTEGER) AS extra_id
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders c
LEFT JOIN LATERAL unnest(string_to_array(c.extras, ',')) AS e(extras) ON true;


SELECT *
FROM extrasBreak

# Solutions

1. What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?
~~~sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT pn.pizza_name, n.pizza_id, pt.topping_name
    FROM pizza_runner.new_recipes AS n
    INNER JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_toppings AS pt
        ON n.toppings = pt.topping_id
    INNER JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names AS pn
        ON pn.pizza_id = n.pizza_id
    ORDER BY pn.pizza_name, n.pizza_id
)
SELECT pizza_name, string_agg(topping_name, ', ') as std_toppings
FROM CTE
GROUP BY pizza_name;
~~~
 pizza_name | std_toppings
:----------:|:-------------:
 Meatlovers |BBQ Sauce, Pepperoni, Cheese, Salami, Chicken, Bacon, Mushrooms, Beef
 Vegetarian |Tomato Sauce, Cheese, Mushrooms, Onions, Peppers, Tomatoes
 
 ---
2. What was the most commonly added extra?
~~~sql
SELECT COUNT (coc.extras),
		pt.topping_name
FROM pizza_runner.customerorders_cleaned AS coc
INNER JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_toppings AS pt
  ON coc.extras = pt.topping_id
GROUP BY extras, topping_name
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 1;
~~~
  count | topping_name
:------:|:-------------:
  4     | Bacon
  
---
3. What was the most common exclusion?
~~~sql
SELECT COUNT (coc.exclusions),
		pt.topping_name
FROM pizza_runner.customerorders_cleaned AS coc
INNER JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_toppings AS pt
  ON coc.exclusions = pt.topping_id
GROUP BY exclusions, topping_name
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 1;
~~~
  count | topping_name
:------:|:--------------:
 4 	| Cheese
 
---
4. Generate an order item for each record in the customers_orders table in the format of one of the following:
   - Meat Lovers
   - Meat Lovers - Exclude Beef
   - Meat Lovers - Extra Bacon
   - Meat Lovers - Exclude Cheese, Bacon - Extra Mushroom, Peppers

To solve this question: 
- Add a record_id to the customer_orders table to select each ordered pizza more easily
- I then created temp tables, see the *Creating Temp Tables* section above for the queries used
- Create 3 CTEs: extras_cte, exclusions_cte, and union_cte combining two tables
- Use the union_cte to LEFT JOIN with the customer_orders table and JOIN with the pizza_name table
- Use the CONCAT_WS with STRING_AGG to get the result

--adding record id column
~~~sql
ALTER TABLE pizza_runner.customer_orders
ADD COLUMN record_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY

SELECT *
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders;

~~~SQL
WITH cteExtras AS 
(SELECT
e.record_id,
'Extra ' || STRING_AGG(t.topping_name, ', ') AS record_options
FROM extrasBreak AS e
JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_toppings AS t
  ON e.extra_id = t.topping_id
GROUP BY e.record_id),
cteExclusions AS 
(SELECT
e.record_id,
'Exclusion ' || STRING_AGG(t.topping_name, ', ') AS record_options
FROM exclusionsBreak AS e
JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_toppings AS t
  ON e.exclusions_id = t.topping_id
GROUP BY e.record_id),
cteUnion AS 
(SELECT * FROM cteExtras
UNION
SELECT * FROM cteExclusions)

SELECT
c.record_id,
c.order_id,
c.customer_id,
c.pizza_id,
c.order_time,
CONCAT_WS(' - ', p.pizza_name, STRING_AGG(u.record_options, ' - ')) AS pizza_info
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders c
LEFT JOIN cteUnion u
  ON c.record_id = u.record_id
JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names p
  ON c.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
GROUP BY
c.record_id,
c.order_id,
c.customer_id,
c.pizza_id,
c.order_time,
p.pizza_name
ORDER BY record_id;

5. Generate an alphabetically ordered comma separated ingredient list for each pizza order from the customer_orders table and add a 2x in front of any relevant ingredients
  - For example: "Meat Lovers: 2xBacon, Beef, ... , Salami"

To solve this question:
- Create a CTE in which each line displays an ingredient for an ordered pizza (add '2x' for extras and remove exclusions as well)
  - Use CONCAT and STRING_AGG to get the result

~~~sql
WITH ingredients AS (
  SELECT 
    co.record_id,
    co.order_id,
    co.customer_id,
    co.pizza_id,
    co.order_time,
    pn.pizza_name,
    CASE 
      WHEN t.topping_id::int IN 
	( SELECT eb.extra_id 
        FROM extrasBreak eb 
        WHERE eb.record_id = co.record_id) THEN '2x ' || pt.topping_name
      ELSE pt.topping_name
    END AS topping
  FROM 
    pizza_runner.customer_orders co
    LEFT JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names pn 
      ON co.pizza_id = pn.pizza_id
    LEFT JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_recipes pr 
      ON co.pizza_id = pr.pizza_id
    LEFT JOIN unnest(string_to_array(pr.toppings, ',')) AS t(topping_id) 
      ON TRUE
    LEFT JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_toppings pt 
      ON t.topping_id::int = pt.topping_id
  WHERE 
    NOT EXISTS 
	(SELECT 1 
      FROM exclusionsBreak eb 
      WHERE co.record_id = eb.record_id 
      AND pt.topping_id = eb.exclusions_id))
SELECT 
  record_id,
  order_id,
  customer_id,
  pizza_id,
  order_time,
  CONCAT(pizza_name, ': ', STRING_AGG(topping, ', ')) AS ingredients_list
FROM ingredients
GROUP BY 
  record_id, 
  order_id,
  customer_id,
  pizza_id,
  order_time,
  pizza_name
ORDER BY 
  record_id;

6. What is the total quantity of each ingredient used in all delivered pizzas sorted by most frequent first?
To solve this question:
- Create a CTE to record the number of times each ingredient was used
  - if extra ingredient, add 2
  - if excluded ingredient, add 0
  - no extras or no exclusions, add 1
~~~sql
WITH frequentIngredients AS (
  SELECT 
    c.record_id,
    t.topping_name,
    CASE
      -- if extra ingredient, add 2
      WHEN t.topping_id IN (
          SELECT extra_id 
          FROM extrasBreak e
          WHERE e.record_id = c.record_id) 
      THEN 2
      -- if excluded ingredient, add 0
      WHEN t.topping_id IN (
          SELECT exclusions_id 
          FROM exclusionsBreak e 
          WHERE c.record_id = e.record_id)
      THEN 0
      -- no extras, no exclusions, add 1
      ELSE 1
    END AS times_used
  FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders c
  JOIN toppingsBreak t
    ON t.pizza_id = c.pizza_id
  JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names p
    ON p.pizza_id = c.pizza_id
)

SELECT 
  topping_name,
  SUM(times_used) AS times_used 
FROM frequentIngredients
GROUP BY topping_name
ORDER BY times_used DESC;
~~~
  topping_name  | times_used
:--------------:|:--------------:
  Mushrooms     | 13
  Bacon         | 13
  Chicken       | 11
  Cheese        | 11
  Pepperoni     | 10
  Salami        | 10
  Beef          | 10
  BBQ Sauce     | 9 
  Tomatoes      | 4
  Onions        | 4
  Peppers       | 4
  Tomato Sauce  | 4
