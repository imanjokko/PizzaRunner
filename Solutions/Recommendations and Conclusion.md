1. Look into 
- What caused restaurant cancellation?
   - It may be difficult to find out why the customer cancelled, but the restaurant should put a cancellation policy in place that protects all parties, i.e. restaurant, customers, and runners.
- Why is runner 4 not yet active?
- What caused delay in the preparation of order 8? And how can it be prevented fom re-occuring?

2. Pizza Runner HQ needs to start with marketing and advertisements, especially with the introduction of the new **Supreme pizza**, it is perfect timing.

3. Take user ratings and feedback seriously, this is important for all businesses, especially early stage ones

4. To better maximize profits, Danny could look into his overall operations cost. 
 - Are the current procurement methods as cost effective as they could be?
 - Are the pizza and delivery prices right? Taking note of what is leftover after paying runners

Overall, the Pizza Runner HQ seems to be doing fairly well for a new business. There are still a lot of areas to explore and look into from a business standpoint, so I hope I did a good enough job for Danny to call me back when he decides to take the next steps at the Pizza HQ. Till then, eat pizza üçï and stay safe!
