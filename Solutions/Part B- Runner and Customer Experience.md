# Solutions
1. How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)
~~~sql
SELECT date_part('week', registration_date +INTERVAL '3 days') AS week_start, COUNT(*) AS num_signups
FROM pizza_runner.runners
GROUP BY week_start
ORDER BY week_start;
--I added the "INTERVAL '3 days'" to ensure that signups within a 3-day period are included in the same week
--This is because postgres's week starts on Mondays, which is the 4th and would've excluded sign ups from earlier
~~~
 week_start   | num_signups
:------------:|:--------------:
 1            | 2
 2            | 1
 3            | 1

2. What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?
~~~sql
SELECT runner_id, avg(time_to_arrival) as avg_arrival_time
FROM (SELECT r.runner_id, (r.pickup_time - c.order_time) AS time_to_arrival
FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders r
INNER JOIN pizza_runner.customer_orders c
ON r.order_id = c.order_id) as arrival_time
GROUP BY runner_id
~~~
 runner_id    | avg_arrival_time
:------------:|:-------------------:
 3            | 00:10:28
 2            | 00:23:43
 1            | 00:15:41

 3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?

   --viewing prep time per order
 ~~~sql
SELECT c.order_id, count (*) as num_pizzas, (r.pickup_time - c.order_time) AS time_to_prepare
FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders r
INNER JOIN pizza_runner.customer_orders c
	ON r.order_id = c.order_id
WHERE r.pickup_time IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY c.order_id, r.pickup_time, c.order_time
~~~
 order_id  | num_pizzas  | time_to_prepare
:---------:|:-----------:|:-----------------:
 1         | 1           | 00:10:32
 2         | 1           | 00:10:02
 7         | 1           | 00:10:16
 4         | 3           | 00:29:17
 3         | 2           | 00:21:14
 10        | 2           | 00:15:31
 5         | 1           | 00:10:28
 8         | 1           | 00:20:29
 
 --looking at the average prep time by amount of pizzas in the order
~~~sql
SELECT num_pizzas, AVG(time_to_prepare) AS avg_prep_time
FROM (SELECT c.order_id, count (*) AS num_pizzas, (r.pickup_time - c.order_time) AS time_to_prepare
	FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders r
	INNER JOIN pizza_runner.customer_orders c
	ON r.order_id = c.order_id
	WHERE r.pickup_time IS NOT NULL
	GROUP BY c.order_id, r.pickup_time, c.order_time) AS prep_time
GROUP BY num_pizzas
~~~
 num_pizzas | avg_prep_time
:----------:|:--------------:
  3         | 00:29:17
  2         | 00:18:22
  1         | 00:12:21
 
- The is yes, ON AVERAGE, there appears to be a relationship between the pizza numbers and delivery time.
  -  **But this is not to be mistaken for causation**

4. What was the average distance travelled for each customer?
~~~sql
SELECT c.customer_id, CEIL(AVG(r.distance_km)) as avg_distance_km
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders c
INNER JOIN pizza_runner.runner_orders r
	ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY c.customer_id
~~~
 customer_id  | avg_distance_km
:------------:|:----------------:
  101         | 20
  102         | 17
  103         | 24
  104         | 10
  105         | 25

5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?
~~~sql
SELECT (max(duration_mins)) - (min(duration_mins)) as duration_diff
FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders
~~~
 duration_diff
:--------------:
  30

6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?

--converting distance and duration to m/s for speed calculation
~~~sql
ALTER TABLE pizza_runner.runner_orders
ADD COLUMN duration_secs INT

UPDATE pizza_runner.runner_orders
SET duration_secs = (duration_mins * 60)

ALTER TABLE pizza_runner.runner_orders
ADD COLUMN distance_m FLOAT

UPDATE pizza_runner.runner_orders
SET distance_m = (distance_km * 1000)

--speed for each delivery
~~~sql
SELECT runner_id, order_id, CEIL((distance_m/duration_secs)) AS delivery_speed
FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders
WHERE cancellation IS NULL
~~~

FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders
GROUP BY runner_id
~~~

:---------:|:-----------------:
  3        | 12
  2        | 18
  1        | 13
  
 - I did not notice any trends here

7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?
~~~sql
SELECT runner_id, 
  ROUND(100 * SUM(CASE WHEN cancellation IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) 
		/ COUNT(*)) AS success_perc
FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders
GROUP BY runner_id;
~~~
 runner_id  | success_perc
:----------:|:--------------:
  3         | 50
  2         | 75
  1         | 100

  # Insights
  
  - Runner 1 had the highest percentage of succesful deliveries
  - Runner 2 is the fastest rider
  - Customer 105 is the one riders have travelled the most distance for
  - Week 1 had the most runner signups
  - The last rider to sign up; runner 4, has not made any deliveries yet
