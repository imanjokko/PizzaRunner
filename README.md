# Introduction- Pizza Runner :pizza:

Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - “80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!”

Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

---
# Problem Statement
Danny has prepared an entity relationship diagram of his database design, but requires further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner’s operations.

---
# Business Task
The task and aim of this project is to provide Danny, the owner of Pizza Runner, with more insights into his business. And to help him optimize operations using the data he has provided.

---
# Skills Demonstrated
- Data Wrangling
- Exploratory Data Analysis
